Error Handling: Provides basic error handling to handle exceptions gracefully.
Dependency Injection: Utilizes Spring's dependency injection to manage dependencies and promote loose coupling.
Command-Line Runner: Includes a command-line runner to perform initial database setup and demonstrate basic functionality.
Technologies Used:
Spring Boot: Provides a robust framework for building and deploying Java-based applications.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): Enables Java applications to interact with relational databases like MySQL.
MySQL: A popular open-source relational database management system.
SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java): Facilitates logging by serving as a simple facade or abstraction for various logging frameworks.
Maven: Used as the build automation tool and dependency management tool for the project.
